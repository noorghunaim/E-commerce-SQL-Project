# E-commerce Project

**ðŸ“– Overview**

This project simulates a small e-commerce platform using SQLite. It demonstrates relational database design, data insertion, and SQL querying to extract meaningful insights. The project is designed to showcase practical skills in SQL, database modeling, and data analysis.

**ðŸ—‚ Database Structure:**

**Tables & Relationships**

1. **Users**
- Stores customer information.
- Columns: user_id (PK), name, email, signup_date

**2. Products**

- Stores product details.
- Columns: product_id (PK), name, category, price, stock

**3. Orders**

- Represents orders placed by users.
- Columns: order_id (PK), user_id (FK), order_date, total_amount

**4. Order_Items**

- Details products in each order.
- Columns: order_item_id (PK), order_id (FK), product_id (FK), quantity, price

**5. Reviews**

- Stores product reviews by users.
- Columns: review_id (PK), product_id (FK), user_id (FK), rating, comment, review_date

- Understanding relational database design and normalization

- Practicing SQL queries of varying complexity

- Modeling real-world e-commerce workflows in a database

The project demonstrates:

- Creation of relational tables with primary and foreign keys.

- Inserting and managing sample data.

- Writing SQL queries for:

  - Basic data retrieval (SELECT, WHERE)
    - List all users:
